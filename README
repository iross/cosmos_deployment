# Running
This is a simplified (but still a bit hacky) interface for running COSMOS that I whipped up. The key files are:

## .env
Defines what images to use and how many workers are registered in the dask cluster. I don't think you'll need to change anything here.

## run.sh
A shell script that drives the entire process. It has some fairly hard-coded paths at the moment, but the idea is that pdfs live in `/hdd/iaross/(some name)_pdfs`, and I want the output stored in `/hdd/iaross/(some name)_output`, with temporary (page-level PNG) files stored in `/hdd/iaross/tmp/(some name)`. When invoked, it will look at the input directory, start up the COSMOS deployment, and then watch it until it notices that it's finished up (checking every ~5 minutes).

### Needed changes
within `run.sh`, you'll need to change the `to_ingest`, and INPUT_DIR, OUTPUT_DIR, and TMP_DIR. You can always use CTRL-C to break out of a running instance if things seem stuck. You should also comment out the for loop that deletes the TMP_DIR images if you want/need to keep them around.
